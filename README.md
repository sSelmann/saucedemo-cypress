# Simple Cypress E2E tests on saucedemo.com

E2E automation with Cypress. These tests are for practice only, and not all parts of the application are covered.

# How to run tests

 1. Install the dependencies
 
```
npm install
```
2. Run tests
```
npx cypress run
```
or run the tests on Cypress Launchpad
```
npx cypress open
```

If you want to run tests another way, you can learn how to run commands in [Cypress Documents](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#How-to-run-commands).
